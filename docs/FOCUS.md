## CURRENT FOCUS

**Phase: POST-MVP HARDENING** ✓

### Active Task

None — Detection bypass hardening completed.

### Latest Fix (2026-01-29)
ZeroMount kernel artifact exposure fixed. `/dev/zeromount` and `/sys/kernel/zeromount` now hidden via SUSFS sus_path_loop.

## GRAVEYARD

### NoMount v1
- **Started:** 2026-01-27
- **Abandoned:** 2026-01-28
- **Days invested:** 1
- **Why abandoned:** Built without understanding metamodule architecture. service.sh grew to 1081 lines fighting the framework. Wrong execution timing forced 4-phase workaround. Universal mount hijacker was unnecessary complexity.
- **Pattern:** Started building before reading documentation.
- **Lesson:** /learn mode exists for a reason. Understanding saves 10x the debugging time.

### Kernel dev_t decode "fix"
- **Started:** 2026-01-29
- **Abandoned:** 2026-01-29
- **Days invested:** 0
- **Why abandoned:** Initial hypothesis was wrong. Kernel encode/decode roundtrip is symmetric and correct. Removing decode calls would have broken stat return values.
- **Pattern:** Assumed bug without tracing full data path.
- **Lesson:** Trace the COMPLETE flow before "fixing" suspicious code. The roundtrip was designed to be symmetric.

## STATS

**Completed:** 10 features
**Abandoned:** 2 (NoMount v1, kernel decode "fix")
**Completion Rate:** 83%

**Goal:** 80%+ completion rate ✓ **ACHIEVED**

## VERIFICATION

All 5 detection apps pass:
- Native Detector (Reveny): ✓ "The Environment is normal"
- Native Test (icu.nullptr): ✓ "Normal"
- Holmes: ✓ "Normal"
- Disclosure (milltina): ✓ "No traces were found"
- Crackme (kikyps): ✓ Pass (after kernel artifact hiding)

**ZeroMount + SUSFS integration verified working.**

### Detection Vectors Closed (2026-01-29)
| Vector | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| `/dev/zeromount` visible | SUSFS sus_path_loop hides from umounted apps |
| `/sys/kernel/zeromount/` visible | SUSFS sus_path_loop hides from umounted apps |
| Sucompat stat() side-channel | Kernel fix: `susfs_is_current_proc_umounted()` check |
